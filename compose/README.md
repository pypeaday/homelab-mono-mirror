# Homelab Compose

My repository for the application that I use docker compose stacks to run "in production"

~~My development stuff is in my [dev repo](https://github.com/pypeaday/homelab-dev)--

## Monitoring

My monitoring stack is in my [monitoring repo](https://github.com/Doomlab7/homelab-monitoring)

Glances/Netdata are apart of `monitoring-visibility` which is copied between the 2 hosts due to slightly different docker groups and traefik config

## Networks

`phantomlink` is my homelab network - created with a simple script in ghost/
